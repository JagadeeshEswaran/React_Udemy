		title: "Q: What is the main difference between useReducer and Redux?",
		info: "A: The main difference is that useReducer is a built-in feature of React, while Redux is a separate library. useReducer provides a more lightweight solution for state management, while Redux offers a more robust and mature approach with a larger ecosystem of tools and plugins.",
	},
	{
		id: 2,
		title: "Q: Which one should I use for my project?",
		info: "A: The answer depends on the specific needs of your project. If you’re building a smaller project with relatively simple state management requirements, useReducer might be a good choice. For larger, more complex projects, Redux may be a better fit due to its extensive tooling and plugin support.",
	},
	{
		id: 3,
		title: "Q: Can useReducer replace Redux?",
		info: "A: useReducer is not a replacement for Redux. However, we can use useReducer with useContext to replace Redux in some cases. It just depends on the complexity of the project and its requirements. ",

	{
		id: 4,
		title: "Q: Can I use both useReducer and Redux in the same project?",
		info: "A: Yes, it’s possible to use both in the same project. However, it’s important to carefully consider whether this is necessary and ensure that the use of both doesn’t lead to unnecessary complexity.",
	},
	{
		id: 5,
		title: "Q: Which one is faster, useReducer or Redux?",
		info: "A: Generally, useReducer is faster due to its more lightweight nature. However, performance can vary depending on the specific use case and the size and complexity of the state being managed.",
